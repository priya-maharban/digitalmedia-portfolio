# digitalmedia-portfolio
Here is my Digital Media Artist portfolio in which you will find the work I've done with graphic design, animation, UI/UX design, &amp; more!
You will notice that this portfolio may contain older projects, this is due to a shift in focus of my work lately which has been into social media content creation & social media marketing! 

If you're interested in my current work I've been doing a lot of video editing, live streaming, and analytics analyzing for proper content creation growth!

FYI: THE WEBSITE ON THE FIRST PAGE IS NO LONGER BEING HOSTED!
